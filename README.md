# CSS Music Visualizer

## About

This is a set of visualizers that are made entirely using DOM elements and CSS3 Animations and Transforms. **There is no SVG, Canvas, WebGL, or visual plug-in used.** This is the kind of stuff CSS can do these days.

*(Everything you see is made from div tags!)*

It uses [Dancer.js](https://github.com/jsantell/dancer.js) a small Web Audio library to get `spectrum` and `waveform` data using the HTML5 audio tag.
